<p>Welcome to my digital sanctuary, where I invite you to explore the road less traveled, unravel the complexities of my journey, and find inspiration to embark on your own transformative path. As a multifaceted individual, I've worn many hats - veteran, devoted mother and nana, master knitter, and website developer. But above all, I am a seeker of meaning, drawing inspiration from great thinkers like Adler and the Stoics.</p>
<h2>Unveiling a Journey of Growth and Resilience</h2>
<p>My career path has been as diverse as it has been enlightening. Serving in the RAAF, I navigated the complexities of military life while finding solace in teaching and technology. From the challenges of loading telex machines to deciphering the enigma of the infamous ration pack, I thrived on problem-solving and illuminating the path forward for those around me.</p>
<p>In 2000, I bid farewell to the RAAF and embarked on a 14-year journey in vocational education, specializing in web design and development. It was a chapter dedicated to finding healing and meaning, as I guided eager learners with meticulous precision, witnessing their growth and evolution.</p>
<h2>Embracing Wisdom and Self-Discovery</h2>
<p>In 2015, I took another transformative step, intertwining the wisdom of Adler and the Stoics into my personal odyssey of healing and self-discovery. Through Codemaster Institute bootcamps, I found a platform to inspire and empower aspiring web enthusiasts, igniting their passion for the digital realm.</p>
<p>Today, my commitment to education and personal growth is stronger than ever. I venture into the digital frontier to empower individuals like you with the skills and knowledge to thrive in the vast landscape of web technologies. Through every thread I knit and website I develop, I showcase the transformative power of web technologies.</p>
<h2>Unleash Your Potential</h2>
<p>So, join me in my digital sanctuary to find solace, unleash creativity, and embark on your own journey of healing and self-discovery. Let's explore the endless possibilities together and expand our horizons. Whether you're a beginner, an experienced developer, or simply seeking inspiration, this sanctuary is a place for learning, growth, and the pursuit of a life less ordinary.</p>
